#
# Example Ingress YML that will sync services in Docker Swarm to the backend.
# The backend is specified by the L4Plugin property.
#
# To run this:
#
# INFRAKIT_MANAGER_BACKEND=swarm infrakit plugin start manager simulator ingress
#
# In another console:
# infrakit ingress controller commit -y path/to/this/file
#
# Creating Docker services
# docker network create --driver overlay --ingress ingress
# docker service create --network ingress --name t2 --publish 7777:80 nginx
#
# Verify that the route has been added in the simulator/lb1:
# infrakit simulator/lb1 routes ls
#
# FRONTEND PORT    PROTOCOL   BACKEND PORT  CERT
# 7777             TCP        7777  <-- from the swarm service
# 80               http       8080  <-- from the static route in the config
#
# In Docker:
#  docker service ls
#ID                  NAME                MODE                REPLICAS            IMAGE               PORTS
#m4fghruao79i        t2                  replicated          1/1                 nginx:latest        *:7777->80/tcp
#
# Remove the service
# docker service rm t2
#
# infrakit simulator/lb1 routes ls  # should be empty
#
# FRONTEND PORT    PROTOCOL   BACKEND PORT  CERT
# 80               http       8080  <-- from the static route

    # and therefore different loadbalancers.  Because it's match-all, it's ok to leave this field out.
