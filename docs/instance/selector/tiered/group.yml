#
#  Tiered provisioning example
#
#  Start up infrakit:
#
#  export INFRAKIT_SELECTOR_TIERED_PLUGINS='spot/compute;ondemand/compute'
#
#  In the env variable above we set the ordering of the plugins...
#  First, we try spot/compute then ondemand/compute.  We will use the 'simulator'
#  kind to simulate the different types of instances by starting the plugin at
#  specific socket addresses: one as ondemand and the other as spot.
#  In the infrakit CLI you will see ondemand/compute and spot/compute as available
#  commands.  These will allow you to directly query the instance plugins.
#
#  infrakit plugin start manager group vanilla simulator:ondemand simulator:spot selector/tiered --log 5 --log-stack
#
#  * Note on the use of env variable...  when we support multiple plugins in a single
#  spec and automatic activation, you will create sections of spec/metadata/Options
#  to actually set the options for the tiered selector.
#
#  Commit this file:
#
#  infrakit group controller commit -y docs/instance/selector/tiered/group.yml
#
#  After a while, you can verify that 3 are created in spot/compute and 2 in ondemand/compute
