Build Module
============

This is an example CLI module.  The name of the directory will be added as a subcommand.
The `.short` file in this directory will be used as the short description of the command.

All files / directories in folder will be added as command. For a directory, a command is
added and its files are added as its sub-commands.

Flags are generated by reading the files and looking for the `{{ flag }}` template function.
